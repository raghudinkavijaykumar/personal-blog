To handle such situations, Java provides a mechanism called \",mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"finalization\"),\". By using finalization, you can define specific actions that will occur when an object is just about to be reclaimed by the garbage collector.

Inside the \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"finalize( )\"),\" method, you will specify those actions that must be performed before an object is destroyed. The garbage collector runs periodically, checking for objects that are no longer referenced by any running state or indirectly through other referenced objects.

The\\xA0enum\\xA0declaration defines a\\xA0*class*\\xA0(called an\\xA0*enum type*). The enum class body can include methods and other fields. The compiler automatically adds some special methods when it creates an enum. For example, they have a static\\xA0values\\xA0method that returns an array containing all of the values of the enum in the order they are declared. This method is commonly used in combination with the for-each construct to iterate over the values of an enum type.

The following example defines a static method that retrieves a\\xA0\",mdx(\"a\",_extends({parentName:\"p\"},{\"href\":\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/ZoneId.html\"}),\"ZoneId\"),\"\\xA0object corresponding to a time zone identifier; it uses the system default time zone if there is no\\xA0ZoneId\\xA0object corresponding to the given identifier.

Javadoc was created by Sun Microsystems for the purpose of generating API documentation in HTML format from java source code. Using the HTML format gives the convenience of being able to hyperlink related documents together. Section 6.1: Building Javadocs From the Command Line Many IDEs provide support for generating HTML from Javadocs automatically; some build tools (Maven and Gradle, for example) also have plugins that can handle the HTML creation. However, these tools are not required to generate the Javadoc HTML; this can be done using the command line javadoc tool. The most basic usage of the tool is: javadoc JavaFile.java Which will generate HTML from the Javadoc comments in JavaFile.java. A more practical use of the command line tool, which will recursively read all java files in [source-directory], create documentation for [package.name] and all sub-packages, and place the generated HTML in the [docsdirectory] is: javadoc -d [docs-directory] -subpackages -sourcepath [source-directory] [package.name] Section 6.2: Class Documentation All Javadoc comments begin with a block comment followed by an asterisk (/\\\\*\\\\*) and end when the block comment does (\\\\*/).

This object contains a complete set of system property definitions.\\n\\n### 16.3.2 Writing System Properties\\n\\nTo modify the existing set of system properties, use\\xA0System.setProperties. This method takes a\\xA0Properties\\xA0object that has been initialized to contain the properties to be set. This method replaces the entire set of system properties with the new set represented by the\\xA0Properties\\xA0object.\\n\\n**Warning:**\\xA0Changing system properties is potentially dangerous and should be done with discretion. Many system properties are not reread after start-up and are there for informational purposes. Changing some properties may have unexpected side-effects.\\n\\nThe next example,\\xA0[PropertiesTest](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/examples/PropertiesTest.java), creates a\\xA0Properties\\xA0object and initializes it from\\xA0[myProperties.txt](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/examples/myProperties.txt)\\xA0.\\n\\nsubliminal.message=Buy StayPuft Marshmallows!\\n\\nPropertiesTest\\xA0then uses\\xA0System.setProperties\\xA0to install the new\\xA0Properties\\xA0objects as the current set of system properties.\\n\\nimport java.io.FileInputStream;\\n\\nimport java.util.Properties;\\n\\npublic class PropertiesTest {\\n\\npublic static void main(String[] args)\\n\\nthrows Exception {\\n\\n// set up new properties object\\n\\n// from file \\\"myProperties.txt\\\"\\n\\nFileInputStream propFile =\\n\\nnew FileInputStream( \\\"myProperties.txt\\\");\\n\\nProperties p =\\n\\nnew Properties(System.getProperties());\\n\\np.load(propFile);\\n\\n// set the system properties\\n\\nSystem.setProperties(p);\\n\\n// display new properties\\n\\nSystem.getProperties().list(System.out);\\n\\n}\\n\\n}\\n\\nNote how\\xA0PropertiesTest\\xA0creates the\\xA0Properties\\xA0object,\\xA0p, which is used as the argument to\\xA0setProperties:\\n\\nProperties p = new Properties(System.getProperties());\\n\\nThis statement initializes the new properties object,\\xA0p, with the current set of system properties, which in the case of this small application, is the set of properties initialized by the runtime system. Then the application loads additional properties into\\xA0p\\xA0from the file\\xA0myProperties.txt\\xA0and sets the system properties to\\xA0p. This has the effect of adding the properties listed in\\xA0myProperties.txt\\xA0to the set of properties created by the runtime system at startup. Note that an application can create\\xA0p\\xA0without any default\\xA0Properties\\xA0object, like this:\\n\\nProperties p = new Properties();\\n\\nAlso note that the value of system properties can be overwritten! For example, if\\xA0myProperties.txt\\xA0contains the following line, the\\xA0java.vendor\\xA0system property will be overwritten:\\n\\njava.vendor=Acme Software Company\\n\\nIn general, be careful not to overwrite system properties.\\n\\nThe\\xA0setProperties\\xA0method changes the set of system properties for the current running application. These changes are not persistent. That is, changing the system properties within an application will not affect future invocations of the Java interpreter for this or any other application. The runtime system re-initializes the system properties each time its starts up. If changes to system properties are to be persistent, then the application must write the values to some file before exiting and read them in again upon startup.\\n\\n## 16.4 The Security Manager\\n\\nA\\xA0*security manager*\\xA0is an object that defines a security policy for an application. This policy specifies actions that are unsafe or sensitive. Any actions not allowed by the security policy cause a[SecurityException](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/SecurityException.html)\\xA0to be thrown. An application can also query its security manager to discover which actions are allowed.\\n\\nTypically, a web applet runs with a security manager provided by the browser or Java Web Start plugin. Other kinds of applications normally run without a security manager, unless the application itself defines one. If no security manager is present, the application has no security policy and acts without restrictions.\\n\\nThis section explains how an application interacts with an existing security manager. For more detailed information, including information on how to design a security manager, refer to the[Security Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/index.html).\\n\\n### 16.4.1 Interacting with the Security Manager\\n\\nThe security manager is an object of type\\xA0[SecurityManager](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/SecurityManager.html); to obtain a reference to this object, invoke\\xA0System.getSecurityManager.\\n\\nSecurityManager appsm = System.getSecurityManager();\\n\\nIf there is no security manager, this method returns\\xA0null.\\n\\nOnce an application has a reference to the security manager object, it can request permission to do specific things. Many classes in the standard libraries do this. For example,\\xA0System.exit, which terminates the Java virtual machine with an exit status, invokes\\xA0SecurityManager.checkExit\\xA0to ensure that the current thread has permission to shut down the application.\\n\\nThe SecurityManager class defines many other methods used to verify other kinds of operations. For example,\\xA0SecurityManager.checkAccess\\xA0verifies thread accesses, and\\xA0SecurityManager.checkPropertyAccess\\xA0verifies access to the specified property. Each operation or group of operations has its own\\xA0check*XXX*()\\xA0method.\\n\\nIn addition, the set of\\xA0check*XXX*()\\xA0methods represents the set of operations that are already subject to the protection of the security manager. Typically, an application does not have to directly invoke any\\xA0check*XXX*()\\xA0methods.\\n\\n### 16.4.2 Recognizing a Security Violation\\n\\nMany actions that are routine without a security manager can throw a\\xA0SecurityException\\xA0when run with a security manager. This is true even when invoking a method that isn't documented as throwing\\xA0SecurityException. For example, consider the following code used to read a file:\\n\\nreader = new FileReader(\\\"xanadu.txt\\\");\\n\\nIn the absence of a security manager, this statement executes without error, provided\\xA0xanadu.txt\\xA0exists and is readable. But suppose this statement is inserted in a web applet, which typically runs under a security manager that does not allow file input. The following error messages might result:\\n```bash\\n*appletviewer fileApplet.html*\\nException in thread \\\"AWT-EventQueue-1\\\" java.security.AccessControlException: access denied (java.io.FilePermission characteroutput.txt write)\\nat java.security.AccessControlContext.checkPermission(AccessControlContext.java:323)\\nat java.security.AccessController.checkPermission(AccessController.java:546)\\nat java.lang.SecurityManager.checkPermission(SecurityManager.java:532)\\nat java.lang.SecurityManager.checkWrite(SecurityManager.java:962)\\nat java.io.FileOutputStream.<init>(FileOutputStream.java:169)\\nat java.io.FileOutputStream.<init>(FileOutputStream.java:70)\\nat java.io.FileWriter.<init>(FileWriter.java:46)\\n\")),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Note that the specific exception thrown in this case,\\xA0\",mdx(\"a\",_extends({parentName:\"p\"},{\"href\":\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/AccessControlException.html\"}),\"java.security.AccessControlException\"),\", is a subclass of\\xA0SecurityException.\"),mdx(\"h2\",null,\"16.5 Miscellaneous Methods in System\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"This section describes some of the methods in\\xA0System\\xA0that aren't covered in the previous sections.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The\\xA0arrayCopy\\xA0method efficiently copies data between arrays.

Depending on the quantifier used, the presence of \\\"nothing\\\" at the index after the last character may or may not trigger a match.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Now change the input string to the letter \\\"a\\\" five times in a row and you'll get the following:\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Enter your regex: a?\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Enter input string to search: aaaaa\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"I found the text \\\"a\\\" starting at index 0 and ending at index 1.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"I found the text \\\"a\\\" starting at index 1 and ending at index 2.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"I found the text \\\"a\\\" starting at index 2 and ending at index 3.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"I found the text \\\"a\\\" starting at index 3 and ending at index 4.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"I found the text \\\"a\\\" starting at index 4 and ending at index 5.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"I found the text \\\"\\\" starting at index 5 and ending at index 5.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Enter your regex: a\",\"*\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Enter input string to search: aaaaa\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"I found the text \\\"aaaaa\\\" starting at index 0 and ending at index 5.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"I found the text \\\"\\\" starting at index 5 and ending at index 5.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Enter your regex: a+\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Enter input string to search: aaaaa\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"I found the text \\\"aaaaa\\\" starting at index 0 and ending at index 5.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The expression\\xA0a?\\xA0finds an individual match for each character, since it matches when \\\"a\\\" appears zero or one times.
